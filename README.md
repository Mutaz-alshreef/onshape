# Mechanical Bracket - CAD Design (Onshape)

This repository contains the 3D design of a mechanical bracket created using [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/), a cloud-based CAD software. The design is likely intended for use in robotics or mechanical assemblies.


## 📁 Files and Structure

- `Assembly 1`: The main assembly that includes all parts of the bracket.
- All design work is saved in Onshape cloud and accessible via shared document link (add it below if available).

## 🧩 Features

- **Curved bracket** with mounting holes.
- Designed for potential integration into mechanical or robotic systems.
- Compatible with 3D printing or CNC machining.
- Lightweight geometry optimized for prototyping.

- **Browser-based Editing**: Supports collaborative online design.

## ⚠️ Notes

- You may see the warning:  
  `"Reduced rendering performance detected. Check system compatibility"`  
  This occurs when your browser or device has limited graphics acceleration support. Consider using a device with better GPU support for optimal performance.
- Also, `"Poor connection"` indicates internet issues which may affect model loading and saving.

## 🚀 Getting Started
